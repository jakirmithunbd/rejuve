                        which applies across the European Union (including in

                        Google Analytics or the Facebook ad pixel to collect
                        certain nonpersonal information about your equipment,
                        browsing actions and patterns. This nonpersonal
                        information will generally include information about
                        your location, your traffic pattern through our Website,
                        and any communications between your computer and our

                        browser type, domain names, access dates and times,
                        referring website addresses, and information about the
                        areas of the Website you visit and search terms you use

                        about your online activities over time and across
                        third-party websites or other online services
                        (behavioral tracking) such as the websites you visited
                        just before and just after this Website. Any such
                        information collected automatically is used for
                        statistical data and will not include personal

                        information collected by them to improve the Website and
                        our service as it enables us to analyze Website
                        performance, estimate our audience size, track usage
                        patterns, save information from your previous visits

                        to use technological equivalents of cookies, including
                        social media pixels. These pixels allow social media
                        sites to track visitors to outside websites so as to
